# ASL
## Overview
This project aims to provide comprehensive education and training in American Sign Language, catering not only to the deaf and hard-of-hearing community but also to individuals seeking to communicate with them effectively.

## Publics Datasets We Used
+ [Massey University (Gesture Dataset 2012)](https://www.massey.ac.nz/~albarcza/gesture_dataset2012.html)
+ [ASL Alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)

+ [ASL Digit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rayeed045/american-sign-language-digit-dataset)

## Our Own Dataset
Due to the limitations of existing public datasets, we created our own ASL dataset which has clarity, noiseless background, and high accuracy to ensure optimal training conditions. This ensures the reliability and effectiveness of our model.
